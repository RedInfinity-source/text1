# About

The code creates a 3D voxel-based environment using the Ursina library in Python, generating colored spheres that move randomly within the scene. The user controls camera movement using keyboard inputs, and a new voxel of the same color is created at the clicked position.

# Features

The Ursina library is a user-friendly game engine built on Python and Panda3D, offering a straightforward way to create 3D games and simulations. Key features include procedural geometry, animation and tweening, pre-made prefabs, procedural 3D primitives, and custom shaders. The environment is voxel-based, consisting of discrete 3D elements (voxels) representing colored spheres. The voxels move randomly within the scene, adding visual interest and realism. Users can control camera movement using keyboard inputs, allowing exploration from different angles. Voxel creation is enabled when a user clicks, creating a new voxel of the same color at the clicked position. The combination of colored spheres and random movement creates an engaging and visually appealing scene. To enhance the experience, users should fine-tune camera controls, adjust movement speed, and experiment with different voxel sizes and colors. For more details and advanced features, explore the Ursina documentation.

# Rating

The Ursina library is used to create a 3D environment, allowing voxel movement and interaction with mouse clicks. It also provides basic camera movement control using keyboard inputs. However, the lack of comments and documentation makes understanding the code difficult, and the use of global variables can lead to unintended side effects.
